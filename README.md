# Role-Based-Application-Access-Package
To create a "Role-Based Application Access Package," you can follow these steps, particularly if you're using Microsoft Entra (formerly Azure AD) for role-based access control (RBAC):

---

### **1. Define Application Roles**
- Sign in to the Microsoft Entra admin center.
- Navigate to **Identity > Applications > App registrations**.
- Select the application you want to define roles for.
- Under **Manage**, choose **App roles** and click **Create app role**.
- Fill in the details:
  - **Display Name**: Name of the role (e.g., "Admin" or "Viewer").
  - **Allowed Member Types**: Specify whether the role is for users, applications, or both.
  - **Value**: Unique identifier for the role.
  - **Description**: Brief explanation of the role's purpose.
- Save the role.

---

### **2. Assign Roles to Users or Groups**
- Go to **Identity > Applications > Enterprise applications**.
- Select the application and navigate to **Users and groups**.
- Click **Add user/group** and assign the appropriate role to users or groups.

---

### **3. Configure Role-Based Access in the Application**
- Ensure the application is set up to read role claims from the token issued by Microsoft Entra.
- Use the roles in the token to enforce access control within the application.

---

### **4. Test the Access Package**
- Log in as a user with a specific role and verify that access is restricted or granted based on the assigned role.
- Adjust roles or permissions as needed.

Please note: I leveraged copilot and to the best of my knowledge, this process ensures secure and efficient role-based access to your application.
