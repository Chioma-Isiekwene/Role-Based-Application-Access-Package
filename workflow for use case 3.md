# To create a "Role-Based Application Access Package," I followed these steps, using Microsoft Entra for role-based access control (RBAC): 
# NOTE: Entra has to do with managing users, applications, and access. However, my account does not allow me to create roles. 
________________________________________
# Step 1. Define Application Roles
•	Sign in to the Microsoft Entra admin center.
 
•	Navigate to Identity > Applications > App registrations.
 
•	Select the application you want to define roles for.
•	Under Manage, choose App roles and click Create app role.
 
•	Fill in the details: 
o	Display Name: Name of the role (e.g., "Admin" or "Viewer").
o	Allowed Member Types: Specify whether the role is for users, applications, or both.
o	Value: Unique identifier for the role.
o	Description: Brief explanation of the role's purpose.
•	Save the role.

# Step 2: Assign Roles to Users or Groups
•	Go to Identity > Applications > Enterprise applications.
 
•	Select the application and navigate to Users and groups.
•	Click Add user/group and assign the appropriate role to users or groups.
________________________________________
# Step 3. Configure Role-Based Access in the Application
•	Ensure the application is set up to read role claims from the token issued by Microsoft Entra.
•	Use the roles in the token to enforce access control within the application.

4. Test the Access Package
•	Log in as a user with a specific role and verify that access is restricted or granted based on the assigned role.
•	Adjust roles or permissions as needed.
